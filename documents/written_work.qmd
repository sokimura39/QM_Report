## Introduction

## Literature Review

Cycling behaviour is affected by a number of factors. @rodriguez2004 explored the impacts of the 

## Research Question

Is there a correlation between the quantity (or duration) of cycle hire trips and the slope of the physical environment?

## Hypothesis





## Data

Transport for London (TfL) makes data for the Santander Cycle Hire Scheme publicly available. The location of docking stations is available from the TfL Unified API [@transportforlondon2023a], where real time availability is updated along with the name, ID, and the number of docks each station has. Usage data is shared on their website as well [@transportforlondon2023], with the ID and name for start and end stations, date and time, duration, and type of cycle (conventional or e-cycle) for every journey taken by Santander Cycles.

LIDAR Composite Digital Terrain Model (DTM) [@environmentalagency2023] with a resolution of 2 m was used for extracting the elevation of docking stations.
