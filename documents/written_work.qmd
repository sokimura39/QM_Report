## Introduction

The London Cycle Hire Scheme (LCHS), widely known as the Santander Cycles, is a dock-based bike share scheme that operates in London since 2010 [@li2019], now having 800 docking stations within central London [@transportforlondon2023a]. Users can use the bikes for journeys between docking stations, allowing for casual usage of bicycles for short, high-frequency, and one-way journeys [@beecham2015; @beroud2012]. The usage data is publicly available, enabling analysis of cycling behaviour.

## Literature Review

The detailed datasets of cycle hire schemes around the world has enabled analysis for cycling behaviour from many aspects.  @gebhart2014 has explored how weather conditions affect the number of bikeshare trips in Washington DC, finding uncomfortable conditions including cold weather, precipitation, and high humidity reduces bikeshare usage.

Research on the relationship between cycling behaviour and the physical environment is limited. @rodriguez2004 explored the impacts of the physical environment such as the topography and the existence of sidewalks and bike paths to modal choices, and have found that a positive slope (uphill) reduces the odds of walking or cycling. This research surveyed the students and staff at a university, which may show a different behaviour from the general public.

Drawing on these two streams, this report has conducted an anlysis on the less-explored relationship between cycle hire scheme usage behaviour and the physical environment.

## Research Question

Is there a correlation between the quantity or duration of cycle hire trips and the slope of the physical environment?

## Hypothesis

The trips involving uphill paths will be discouraged, thus leading to a smaller number of trips done by the cycle hire scheme.For the trips that do occur, the duration will be significantly longer compared to their downhill counterparts. Journeys made by ebikes are less disencouraged by uphills compared to classic bikes. 

## Data

### Data Sources

Transport for London (TfL) makes data for the LCHS publicly available. The location of the 800 docking stations is available from the TfL Unified API [@transportforlondon2023a], where real time availability is updated along with the name, ID, and the number of docks each station has. Usage data is shared on their website as well [@transportforlondon2023], with the ID and name for start and end stations, date and time, duration, and type of cycle (conventional or e-cycle) for every journey taken by the LCHS.

The spatial data is joined by the physical attributes from other resources to extract the required information. LIDAR Composite Digital Terrain Model (DTM) [@environmentalagency2023] with a resolution of 2 m was used for extracting elevation. Statistical boundaries and congestion charge boundaries used are from the London Datastore [@greaterlondonauthority2014; @greaterlondonauthority2019].

Accessibility by other public transport modes also impact the usage of bicycle hire schemes [@gebhart2014]. In London, the accessibility by public transport (buses, rail, tube, and tram) is evaluated by an Access Index assigned to each 100 m grid within the Greater London area, which is then categorised into Public Transport Accessibility Levels (PTAL) [@transportforlondon2015a]. We will use the Access Index published by @transportforlondon2015 for each docking station.

### Summary of data

The scope of analysis is the journeys taken on the LCHS from December 2022 to November 2023, the most recent one-year period where data is available. There is a total of 8,414,631 journeys taken during this period, of which .

The summary of the data is shown as follows.

| Statistics | Classic Cycles | E-cycles | Total |
|===|---|---|---|
| Number of Trips | 7,808,234 | 606,397 | 8,414,631 |
| Mean Travelled Distance [m] | 2279.41 | 3124.62 | 2340.32 |
| Mean Height Difference [m] | -0.23 | -0.07 | -0.22 |

: **Table 1**: Characteristics of journeys made by the LCHS 

As a whole, the average height difference between the origin and destination is -0.22 metres, a slight negative value indicating downhill travel is slightly preferred over their uphill counterparts. Different behaviour can be observed for the classic cycles and e-cycles in terms of distance and height difference. Longer distance and the smaller difference in height infer e-cycles allows journeys more physically demanding to the cyclists. From this comparison between the classic cycles and e-cycles, we believe that the physical intensity of cycling may have a correlation on the journeys taken on the LCHS.

There are many factors that influence the choice of travel mode, and we cannot immediately conclude the height difference is the decisive factor. This report will attempt to identify the effect of the height difference on the journeys. From this point, our focus will be on journeys made by classic cycles.

### Spatial Distribution of Cycling Behaviour

The spatial characteristics (although not the main focus of this report) is an important aspect of cycling behaviour. We will define Central London as the congestion charge zone [@transportforlondon] which is roughly the area within the Ring Road. The following table shows the characteristics of journeys, classified by their relation to the Central London area.

| Origin: | Outside || Inside ||
| Destination: | Outside | Inside | Outside | Inside |
|===|---|---|---|---|
| Number of Trips | 3,788,352	| 1,432,552 | 1,265,977 | 1,927,750 |
| Mean Travelled Distance [m] | 1972.20 | 3290.51 | 3294.99 | 1730.68 |
| Mean Height Difference [m] | -0.17 | -0.04 | -0.73 | -0.11 |

: Number of Journeys made by all cycles in relation with the Congestion Charge Zone

Comparing the journeys that start outside the central area and finish within the central area (hereinafter inbound journeys) to the ones originating at the center and terminating outside (outbound journeys), there are less outbound journeys indicating cycling is not chosen as the mode of transport, despite the fact that outbound journeys tend to be more downhill (larger difference in mean height difference.)
Although the reason behind this is unknown and out of the scope of this research (one brave assumption may be that commuters do not wish to engage in cycling after their working hours), this is one parameter we must consider in further analysis.

## Methodology

### Summarizing the data into Origin-Destination pairs

In order to conduct a quantitative analysis on the amount of journeys taken by cyclists, we will summarise the data by grouping them according to their origin and destination. For this analysis, MSOAs will be used as the unit of analysis.  We have first grouped the journeys by origin and destination by docking stations, then regrouping them based on MSOA of their origin and destination. 
There are 160 MSOAs where at least one docking station exists, therefore the summarised dataset includes 25,600 rows of data. By removing journeys that start and finish within the same MSOA, we have 25,440 rows of data for analysis.

#### Subsetting dataset for initial analysis

Considering the whole origin-destination matrix will include various factors unidentified, thus we will first conduct the analysis on a subset of the dataset. We will extract the journeys involving specific MSOAs as a starting point, and conduct an analysis on the subset. The results acquired will be applied to the whole matrix afterwards for further analysis.
Two subsets were created for this first analysis: journeys involving the City of London (code: E02000001) at the center of the city, and involving the MSOA of Primrose Hill (E02000183) in the Borough of Camden outside the cental zone.

### Explanatory factors

In order to analyse the impact of the height difference, a multiple regression model is conducted to differentiate the impacts of height difference from other explanatory variables. Other potential explanatory variables are listed as follows:

- distance of journey
- population density
- access to public transport
- number of ports in MSOA
- direction of journey

When considering the subset using one MSOA as the origin or destination, characteristics for the other end of the journey was stored for regression. Upon analysis for the whole dataset, the characteristics for origin and destination were both used to consider the impact. The direction of journey for the whole dataset will be represented by the ratio of stations within the central zone, due to the fact that some MSOAs stretch through the borders of the central zone defined. 

#### Analysis of variables

The scatter plots for each of the potential explanatory variables are shown as follows.

The scatter plot suggests the distance may have a power law correlation with the number of journeys. A linear regression on log-log scale returns a coefficient of -2.3, indicating the inverse squared value of distance may have a better correlation with the number of journeys. Assuming other variables have a linear correlation (if any at all), the following model will be used for further analysis.

$$
y = \frac{\beta_{\text{dist}}}{(x_{\text{dist}})^2} + \sum_i{\beta_ix_i}
$$

- $x_{\text{dist}}$: distance of journey
- $x_i$: other explanatory variables
- $\beta$: coefficients

By storing the inverse squared value of distance (km^2^) in the `distance_inv_sq` variable, the linear regression model will consist of the following dependent variables.

| Criteria | Variables (subset analysis) | Variables (whole dataset analysis) |
|===|---|---|
| independent variable (number of journeys) | `Number` ||
| distance of journey | `distance_inv_sq` ||
| population density | `other_pop` | `start_pop` `end_pop` |
| access to public transport (Access Index) | `other_AI2015 ` | `start_AI2015` `end_AI2015` |
| number of stations in MSOA | `other_stations` | `start_stations` `end_stations` |
| ratio of stations within central zone | - | `start_cc_zone` | `end_cc_zone` |
| direction of journey | `is_outbound` | - |

## Results

### Analysis of subset

We will first consider the analysis on the journeys to and from the City of London.

The correlation matrix for each dependent variable and the independent variable are shown in the figure below.

All coefficients are below 0.8, indicating there is no multicollinearity between dependent variables. The variance inflation factors for each variable do not exceed the threshold of 5, justifying all variables for linear regression. The results of the regression model is as follows:

| Variable | Coefficient | Standard Error | $t$ | $P > |t|$ |
|===|---|---|---|---|
| Constant | -3323.50 | 716.689 | -4.637 | 0.000 |
| `distance_inv_sq` | 22646.6 | 2047.351 | 11.061 | 0.000 |
| `height_diff` | 0.7890 | 20.106 | 0.039 | 0.969 |
| `other_stations` | 553.0692 | 55.627 | 9.943 | 0.000 |
| `other_AI2015` | 34.8973 | 11.462 | 3.045 | 0.003 |
| `other_pop` | 0.0290 | 0.065 | 0.446 | 0.656 |
| `is_outbound` | 291.4769 | 362.037 | 0.805 | 0.421 |

: Coefficient table for linear regression model

The adjusted R-squared value of this regression model is $R^2 = 0.623$. 

The distance, the number of stations in area, the accessibility by public transport are the significant factors that impact the number of journeys taken.
