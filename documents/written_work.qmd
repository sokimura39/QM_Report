## Introduction

Cycle hire schemes are spreading rapidly in cities in the 21st century. This has greatly impacted the transport system in cities, by increasing the share of cycling and public transport usage, lowering greenhouse gas emmisions, and improving public health [@demaio2009]. Since the first implication of the cycle hire scheme in Amsterdam in the 1960s, the system has seen technological and methodological improvements over time. The modern system equipped with electronic self-serve docking stations and integration with technology has enabled users to use cycles between different stations, allowing for casual usages for short, high-frequency and one-way journeys[@beecham2015; @beroud2012].

The London Cycle Hire Scheme (LCHS), widely known as the Santander Cycles, is one of these systems. In service since 2010 [@li2019], it has 800 docking stations within central London [@transportforlondon2023a]. Users are charged on a timed basis for one-time usage, or can opt into memberships allowing unlimited rides up to 60 minutes at a time [@transportforlondonb]. 

## Literature Review

The detailed datasets of cycle hire schemes such as LCHS around the world has enabled analysis for cycling behaviour from many aspects. @gebhart2014 has explored how weather conditions affect the number of bikeshare trips in Washington DC, finding uncomfortable conditions including cold weather, precipitation, and high humidity reduces bikeshare usage. @wood2011 explored the visualisation of journeys taken by the LCHS, illustrating two major patterns of usage: leisure usage often seen near Royal Parks and commuting to and from major train stations in peak hours.

Meanwhile, research on the relationship between cycling behaviour and the physical environment is limited [@heinen2010]. A small number of past researches [@rodriguez2004; @parkin2008] show that hilliness has a negative impact on cycling. The terrain is quantified in different ways, one segmenting the actual routes surveyed, while the other calculates the average percentage of slope using raster data.

Drawing on these two streams, this report has conducted an anlysis on the unexplored relationship between cycle hire scheme usage behaviour and the physical environment.

## Research Question

Is there a correlation between the quantity or duration of cycle hire trips and the slope of the physical environment?

## Hypothesis

There will be less journeys involving uphill routes. This will be measured from two perspectives:
1. Docking stations located in lower elevations have more arriving journeys than departures, while stations with high elevation being the opposite.
2. There will be a smaller number of trips for origin-destination pairs requiring uphill travel.

## Data

### Data Sources

Transport for London (TfL) makes data for the LCHS publicly available. The location of the 800 docking stations is available from the TfL Unified API [@transportforlondon2023a], where real time availability is updated along with the name, ID, and the number of docks each station has. Usage data is shared on their website as well [@transportforlondon2023], with the ID and name for start and end stations, date and time, duration, and type of cycle (conventional or e-cycle) for every journey taken by the LCHS.

The spatial data is joined by the physical attributes from other resources to extract the required information. LIDAR Composite Digital Terrain Model (DTM) [@environmentalagency2023] with a resolution of 2 m was used for extracting elevation. Statistical boundaries and congestion charge boundaries used are from the London Datastore [@greaterlondonauthority2014; @greaterlondonauthority2019].

Accessibility by other public transport modes also impact the usage of bicycle hire schemes [@gebhart2014]. In London, this is evaluated by an Access Index (AI) published by @transportforlondon2015, which is then categorised into Public Transport Accessibility Levels (PTAL) [@transportforlondon2015a]. An AI of 2.5 or below will be classified as the lowest band (1a), while an index above 40 will be classified as the highest (6b).

### Summary of data

The scope of analysis is the journeys taken on the LCHS from December 2022 to November 2023, the most recent one-year period where data is available. There is a total of 8,414,631 journeys taken during this period. The summary of the data is shown as follows.

| Statistics | Classic Cycles | E-cycles | Total |
|===|---|---|---|
| Number of Trips | 7,808,234 | 606,397 | 8,414,631 |
| Mean Travelled Distance [m] | 2279.41 | 3124.62 | 2340.32 |
| Mean Height Difference [m] | -0.23 | -0.07 | -0.22 |

: **Table 1**: Characteristics of journeys made by the LCHS 

As a whole, the average height difference between the origin and destination is -0.22 metres, a slight negative value indicating downhill travel is slightly preferred over their uphill counterparts. A one-sample t-test shows this value is significant compared to the expected mean of 0.

Different behaviour can be observed for the classic cycles and e-cycles in terms of distance and height difference. Longer distance and the smaller difference in height infer e-cycles allows journeys more physically demanding to the cyclists. From this comparison between the classic cycles and e-cycles, we believe that the physical intensity of cycling may have a correlation on the journeys taken on the LCHS.

There are many factors that influence the choice of travel mode, and we cannot immediately conclude the height difference is the decisive factor. This report will attempt to identify the effect of the height difference on the journeys. From this point, our focus will be on journeys made by classic cycles.

### Spatial Distribution of Cycling Behaviour

The spatial characteristics (although not the main focus of this report) is an important aspect of cycling behaviour. We will define Central London as the congestion charge zone [@transportforlondon] which is roughly the area within the Ring Road. The following table shows the characteristics of journeys, classified by their relation to the Central London area.

| Origin: | Outside || Inside ||
| Destination: | Outside | Inside | Outside | Inside |
|===|---|---|---|---|
| Number of Trips | 3,788,352	| 1,432,552 | 1,265,977 | 1,927,750 |
| Mean Travelled Distance [m] | 1972.20 | 3290.51 | 3294.99 | 1730.68 |
| Mean Height Difference [m] | -0.17 | -0.04 | -0.73 | -0.11 |

: **Table 2**: Number of Journeys made by all cycles in relation with the Congestion Charge Zone

Comparing the journeys that start outside the central area and finish within the central area (hereinafter inbound journeys) to the ones originating at the center and terminating outside (outbound journeys), there are less outbound journeys indicating cycling is not chosen as the mode of transport, despite the fact that outbound journeys tend to be more downhill (larger difference in mean height difference.)
Although the reason behind this is unknown, this is one parameter we must consider.

## Methodology

This research will be conducted in two parts, each addressing the two hypotheses proposed. The first part will consider the usage of individual docking stations, followed by the second part focusing on origin-destination combinations.

### Analyse the usage of individual docking stations

First, we will focus on the usage of individual docks to test the first hypothesis. The number of journeys that originated and terminated at each docking station will be counted, and the ratio of departing journeys compared to the arriving journeys (hereinafter "DA ratio") will be calculated as our target variable. This will be compared to the elevation and other characteristics of the station in a regression model. The other dependent variables are the number of ports per station, whether the station is within the central zone, the TfL access index, and the population density of MSOA the station is located within.

### Summarizing the data into Origin-Destination pairs

In order to conduct a quantitative analysis on the amount of journeys taken by cyclists, we will summarise the data by grouping them according to their origin and destination. For this analysis, MSOAs will be used as the unit of analysis in order to reduce the size of the matrix. There are 160 MSOAs where at least one docking station exists, therefore the summarised dataset includes 25,600 rows of data. By removing journeys that start and finish within the same MSOA, we have 25,440 rows of data for analysis.

A multiple regression model is conducted to differentiate the impacts of height difference from other explanatory variables summarised by @heinen2010. Other potential explanatory variables in this research are as follows:

- distance of journey (average distance between docking stations)
- population density of MSOA
- access to public transport (average AI value of stations)
- number of docking stations in MSOA
- direction of journey

When considering the subset using one MSOA as the origin or destination, characteristics for the other end of the journey was stored for regression. Upon analysis for the whole dataset, the characteristics for origin and destination were both used to consider the impact. The direction of journey for the whole dataset will be represented by the ratio of stations within the central zone, due to the fact that some MSOAs stretch through the borders of the central zone defined. 

#### Analysis of variables

The scatter plots for each of the potential explanatory variables are shown as follows.

The scatter plot suggests the distance may have a power law correlation with the number of journeys. A linear regression on log-log scale returns a coefficient of -2.3, indicating the inverse squared value of distance may have a better correlation with the number of journeys. Assuming other variables have a linear correlation (if any at all), the following model will be used for further analysis.

$$
y = \frac{\beta_{\text{dist}}}{(x_{\text{dist}})^2} + \sum_i{\beta_ix_i}
$$

- $x_{\text{dist}}$: distance of journey
- $x_i$: other explanatory variables
- $\beta$: coefficients

By storing the inverse squared value of distance (/km^2^) in the `distance_inv_sq` variable, the linear regression model will consist of the following dependent variables.

| Criteria | Variables (subset analysis) | Variables (whole dataset analysis) |
|===|---|---|
| independent variable (number of journeys) | `Number` ||
| distance of journey | `distance_inv_sq` ||
| population density | `other_pop` | `start_pop` `end_pop` |
| access to public transport (AI) | `other_AI2015 ` | `start_AI2015` `end_AI2015` |
| number of stations in MSOA | `other_stations` | `start_stations` `end_stations` |
| ratio of stations within central zone | - | `start_cc_zone` | `end_cc_zone` |
| direction of journey | `is_outbound` | - |

## Results

### Analysis of Individual Points

The relationship between the elevation and the number of departures, arrivals, and the ratio are shown in the figure below. The DA ratio has a linear correlation with the elevation, and is statistically significant explaining 11.0 % of the variance in the DA ratio.

![Relationship between elevation and docking station usage]()

Now, we will consider the multiple linear regression for the DA ratio. The Pearson's correlation matrix below shows no sign of multicollinearity, and some linear correlation between the independent variable and the dependent variables. 

![Pearson's correlation matrix for DA ratio analysis]()

The results of the regression model is as follows.

| Variable | Coefficient | Standard Error | $t$ | $P > |t|$ |
|:===|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Constant | 0.9246 | 0.018 | 52.034 | 0.000 |
| `Height` | 0.0049 | 0.000 | 11.783 | 0.000 |
| `cc_zone` | -0.0567 | 0.011 | -5.268 | 0.000 |
| `ports` | 0.0003 | 0.000 | 0.794 | 0.427 |
| `AI2015` | -0.0005 | 0.000 | -2.757 | 0.006 |
| `MSOA_pop_density` | 4.6302 | 0.660 | 7.011 | 0.000 |

: Results of the regression model. Adjusted R-squared value: $R^2 = 0.286$. The height, location, accessibility and the population density are statistically significant, while the number of ports per station is insignificant.

The factors that lead to more departures than arrivals are the elevation and the population density of the area, while locating in the central zone and the accessibility to public transport lead to more arriving journeys. A 1 m rise in elevation leads to a 0.5 % increase in departures compared to arrivals. stations in the highest PTAL band (AI > 40) will have 2 % more arrivals than departures compared to the lowest band (AI < 2.5).

### Analysis of the origin-destination flow

We have extracted 2 areas as the focus for the linear regression model, and have seen that the factors explained have some explanatory power when applied to journeys involving particular areas. We will now apply this to the original dataset as a whole.

The correlation matrix is shown as follows:

![Pearson's correlation matrix for OD analysis]()

There is a collinearity between the number of stations per area, the accessibility by public transport, and whether the docks are in the central area, although this is below the threshold of 5 for a VIF analysis. The results of the regression model is as follows:

| Variable | Coefficient | Standard Error | $t$ | $P > |t|$ |
|:===|---:|---:|---:|---:|
|Constant|-482.8715|30.011|-16.090|0.000|
|`distance_inv_sq`|817.9024|16.343|50.046|0.000|
|`height_diff`|-0.4716|0.422|-1.119|0.263|
|`start_stations`|61.4233|1.621|37.884|0.000|
|`end_stations`|66.8177|1.621|41.211|0.000|
|`start_AI2015`|1.0362|0.353|2.933|0.003|
|`end_AI2015`|1.0950|0.353|3.100|0.002|
|`start_pop_density`|-0.0009|0.001|-0.831|0.406|
|`end_pop_density`|-0.0020|0.001|-1.866|0.062|
|`start_cc_zone`|21.5298|23.612|0.912|0.362|
|`end_cc_zone`|22.7766|23.612|0.965|0.335|

: Results of the regression model. Adjusted R-squared value is $R^2 = 0.283$. The significant variables are the distance, number of stations and the accessibility to public transport. The difference in height, along with the population density and the relationship with the central zone is not a significant factor. Although insignificant, it is worth noting the population density of the end points had lower P-value compared to that of origin.

The model shows that there will be more travel between MSOAs if the distance between the MSOAs are smaller, there are more stations within each MSOA, or there is high public transport availability.

## Discussion

### The impact of elevation

From the results, we can conclude that there is some relationship between elevation and LCHS journeys. With focus on the individual stations, stations located in elevated areas see more departures than arrivals, which aligns with previous research and empirical observations where an uphill journey has a negative impact on cycling. On the other hand, the frequency of travel between MSOAs are not impacted by the relative difference in their height. 

The first point of discussion is that the relative difference in height may not be a good representation of hilliness that negatively impacts cycling, presenting a limitation of this research. Hills encountered en route, the steepness of slope, and the overall hilliness of the terrain are not considered, which the methodology to quantify and the correlation with frequency are both potential fields of further research. 

The second point is that slope may be irrelavant for the overall route selection. London is a flat city with over 75 % of the stations are located within a 20-metre range in elevation, the small difference may not be significant enough to alter mode choice in the macro scale. The difference observed in the scale of individual ports may be caused by choice within the area, where cyclists prefer departing from high stations but return at nearby stations with lower elevation. Further analysis, considering intra-MSOA differences should be conducted to confirm.

### Other factors influencing frequency

Through this research, other decisive factors affecting cycling behaviour were discovered. Closer distances between areas saw more journeys between them, which aligns with previous literature. The positive correlation between public transport accessibility and cycling behaviour indicate bike-and-ride usage is becoming common practice in London, which merits public transport users by reducing door-to-door travel time [@marten2007]. On a micro-scale, high accessibility to public transport favors more arrivals, which suggests *ride-and-bike* is less frequent than *bike-and-ride*. 

Interestingly, some factors triggering assymetry among outbound and return trips have been discovered. High population density leads to more departures, while being in the central zone increases arrivals. This may indicate Londoners cycle on their way to the city centre, but use other transport modes on their way back. The reasons, whether it might be the darkness as suggested by @stinton2004, influence of alcohol, or simply not wanting to engage in cycling after a long day, is a potential area for future exploration.

### Limitations

This research has not considered all factors that may influence cycling behaviour, such as socio-economic factors, infrastructure, and weather. The variables may be proxies of the actual dominant conditions, in which case my discussions may be drawing incorrect conclusions. The journeys by classic cycles on LCHS may not be the representation of the cycling behaviour in London as a whole, which does not take into consideration private cycles, e-scooters, and other bicycle hire schemes. 

## Conclusion

In this research, we have created a dataset of journeys taken by the LCHS, with added information on the elevation and accessibility to public transport for origins and destinations of each journey. The correlation between elevation of individual docking stations and departure-arrival ratio has shown uphill travels have negative impact on cycling behaviour, although this pattern could not be observed when considering the macro-scale origin-destination journey frequency.  The field of studying cycling behaviour through cycle hire data is growing rapidly [@beecham2015], and further research is expected for the better understanding of the effect of the physical environment on cycle hire flows.
