## Introduction and Literature Review

The rapid spread of cycle hire schemes is impacting cities worldwide, by increasing the share of cycling and public transport usage, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and improving public health [@demaio2009]. Since its first implication in Amsterdam in the 1960s, the systems have seen technological and methodological improvements over time. The modern system equipped with telecommunication technology has enabled casual usages between different stations, encouraging short, high-frequency and one-way journeys[@beecham2015; @beroud2012]. The London Cycle Hire Scheme (LCHS), known as the Santander Cycles, is one of these systems. In service since 2010 [@li2019], it has 800 docking stations within central London [@transportforlondon2023a]. 

The detailed datasets of cycle hire schemes has enabled analysis for cycling behaviour from many aspects. @gebhart2014 has found uncomfortable weather conditions reduces bikeshare usage, and accessibility to other public transport modes also impact usage through research of Washington DC. @wood2011 explored the visualisation of journeys taken by the LCHS, illustrating two major patterns of usage: leisure usage often seen near Royal Parks and commuting to and from major train stations in peak hours.

Meanwhile, research on the relationship between cycling behaviour and the physical environment is limited [@heinen2010]. A small number of past researches [@rodriguez2004; @parkin2008] show that hilliness has a negative impact on cycling. The terrain is quantified in different ways, one segmenting the actual routes surveyed, while the other calculates the average percentage of slope using raster data.

Drawing on these two streams, this report has conducted an anlysis on the unexplored relationship between cycle hire scheme usage behaviour and the physical environment.

## Research Question

Does the slope of the physical environment impact the number of cycle hire trips?

## Hypotheses

We hypothesised there will be less journeys under hilly conditions, and tested the following two perspectives:

1. Docking stations located in lower elevations have more arriving journeys than departures, while stations with high elevation having more departures.
2. There will be a smaller number of trips for origin-destination pairs requiring uphill travel.

## Data

### Data Sources

### Summary of data

The scope of analysis is the journeys on the LCHS from December 2022 to November 2023, the most recent one-year period where data is available. 

| Statistics | Classic Cycles | E-cycles | Total |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| Number of Trips | 7,808,234 | 606,397 | 8,414,631 |
| Mean Travelled Distance [m] | 2279.41 | 3124.62 | 2340.32 |
| Mean Height Difference of Travel [m] | -0.23 | -0.07 | -0.22 |

: Characteristics of journeys made by the LCHS 

The negative average in height difference indicate downhill travel is slightly preferred. A one-sample t-test shows this value is significantly different from 0. Journeys by e-cycles are longer and have less height difference compared to conventional cycles, suggesting physically demanding journeys are avoided by classic cycle users.

## Methodology

This research is conducted in two parts. We have first analysed individual docking stations, followed by an analysis on origin-destination combinations. The threshold for the p-value is $p<0.05$. An extensive literature review by @heinen2010 has summarised factors affecting cycling behaviour, and based on the data availability we have considered the following variables:

- distance of journey (average distance between docking stations)
- population density of MSOA
- access to public transport (average AI value of stations)
- number of docking stations in MSOA
- direction of journey

### Analyse the usage of individual docking stations

The ratio of departing journeys compared to arrivals (hereinafter "DA ratio") was tested against elevation and additional factors in a linear regression model. The number of ports per station, the location of station relative to the central zone, the AI, and the population density of MSOA were considered as additional factors.

### Summarising the data into Origin-Destination pairs

We have grouped the data by origin and destination, classified by MSOA. There are 160 MSOAs where LCHS operates, therefore the summarised dataset includes 25,600 rows of data. By removing journeys that start and finish within the same MSOA, we have 25,440 rows of data for analysis.

#### Analysis of variables

The scatter plot between distance and the number of journeys is shown in @fig-scatter-MSOA, on a linear, semi-log and a log-log scale.

![Correlation of Distance and Number of Journeys between MSOAs](img/scatter_MSOA.png){#fig-scatter-MSOA}

The semi-log plot resembles a linear correlation, while the log-log plot has an upward convex. Thus, the relationship between distance and number of journeys follow an exponential relation. The model we will use to estimate the number of journeys is as follows:

$$
y = \exp(\alpha_\text{dist}) \cdot \exp(\beta_\text{dist} x_\text{dist}) + \sum_i{\beta_ix_i} + \alpha
$$

- $x_{\text{dist}}$: distance of journey
- $\beta_\text{dist}(=-0.00056)$: coefficient for exponential law (slope of semi-log regression line)
- $\alpha_\text{dist}$: constant for exponential law (intercept of semi-log regression line)
- $x_i$: other explanatory variables
- $\alpha$: constant for linear regression
- $\beta_i$: coefficients for linear regression

By considering $\exp(\beta_\text{dist} x_\text{dist})$ as one new variable `distance_exp` and $\exp(\alpha_\text{dist})$ as its coefficient, the algorithm for a multiple linear regression can be utilised for our proposed model.

## Results

### Analysis of Individual Points

@fig-elev-scatter shows the relationship between elevation and cycling behaviour. The linear correlation between elevation and the DA ratio is statistically significant, explaining 11.0 % of the variance.

![Relationship between elevation and docking station usage](img/elev_scatter.png){#fig-elev-scatter}

The results of the regression model is as follows. There was no multicollinearity between the variables, using the threshold of Variance Inflation Factor of 5.

| Variable | Coefficient | Standard Error | $t$ | $P > |t|$ |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Constant | 0.9246 | 0.018 | 52.034 | 0.000 |
| `Height` | 0.0049 | 0.000 | 11.783 | 0.000 |
| `cc_zone` | -0.0567 | 0.011 | -5.268 | 0.000 |
| `ports` | 0.0003 | 0.000 | 0.794 | 0.427 |
| `AI2015` | -0.0005 | 0.000 | -2.757 | 0.006 |
| `MSOA_pop_density` | 4.6302 | 0.660 | 7.011 | 0.000 |

: Results of the regression model. Adjusted R-squared value: $R^2 = 0.286$. The height, location, accessibility and the population density are statistically significant, while the number of ports per station is insignificant.

The factors that lead to more departures than arrivals are the elevation and the population density of the area, while locating in the central zone and the accessibility to public transport lead to more arrivals. A 1 m rise in elevation leads to a 0.5 % increase in departures compared to arrivals. stations in the highest PTAL band (AI > 40) will have 2 % more arrivals than departures compared to the lowest band (AI < 2.5). We have confirmed the homoscedasticity and normal distribution of errors is being fulfilled.

### Analysis of the origin-destination flow

Now, we will analyse the flow of cycles using an origin-destination analysis. The result of the regression model is as follows. No variables showed multicollinearity using VIF analysis.

| Variable | Coefficient | Standard Error | $t$ | $P > |t|$ |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
|Constant|-552.5421|28.093|-19.668|0.000|
|`distance_exp`|2.7091|0.034|80.581|0.000|
|`height_diff`|-0.4716|0.394|-1.196|0.232|
|`start_stations`|57.9386|1.517|38.186|0.000|
|`end_stations`|63.3330|1.517|41.741|0.000|
|`start_AI2015`|0.6236|0.330|1.887|0.059|
|`end_AI2015`|0.6825|0.330|2.065|0.039|
|`start_pop_density`|-0.0026|0.001|-2.569|0.010|
|`end_pop_density`|-0.0037|0.001|-3.675|0.000|
|`start_cc_zone`|25.3524|22.087|1.148|0.251|
|`end_cc_zone`|26.5992|22.087|1.204|0.228|

: Results of the regression model. Adjusted R-squared value: $R^2 = 0.373$. Distance, number of stations and the population density are significant. The difference in height, along with the relationship with the central zone is not a significant factor. AI of destination is statistically significant, while AI of origin is not ($p > 0.05$).

The model shows that there will be more travel between MSOAs if the distance between the MSOAs are smaller, there are more stations within each MSOA, or the population density is smaller.

## Discussion

### The impact of elevation

From these results, we can conclude that there is some relationship between elevation and LCHS journeys. With focus on individual stations, stations located in elevated areas see more departures than arrivals, which aligns with previous research and empirical observations where an uphill journey has a negative impact on cycling. On the other hand, the frequency of travel between MSOAs are not impacted by the relative difference in their height. 

The first point of discussion is that the relative height difference may not be representing hilliness that negatively impacts cycling, presenting a limitation of this research. Hills encountered en route, the steepness of slope, and the general hilliness of the terrain are not considered, which the methodology to quantify and the correlation with frequency are both potential fields of further research. 

A second possibility is that slope may be irrelavant for the overall route selection. London is a flat city with over 75 % of the stations located between 0-20 m in elevation, and the small difference may not be enough to alter mode choice in the macro scale. The difference observed in the scale of individual ports may be caused by choice within the area, where cyclists prefer departing from high stations but return at nearby stations with lower elevation. Further analysis, considering intra-MSOA differences should be conducted to confirm.

### Other factors influencing frequency

Other decisive factors affecting cycling behaviour were discovered. Closer distances between areas saw more journeys between them, which aligns with previous literature. The negative correlation between population density is counterintuitive, but one explanation can be related to frequent leisure cycling in parks and open spaces [@wood2011]. 

An interesting relationship can be observed in relation to public transport, where accessibility to the origin is not as statistically significant as the accessibility to the destination. The positive correlation itself indicate bike-and-ride usages [@martens2007] combining public transport and cycle share is a common behaviour. Considering the assymetry between origin and destination, a *ride-and-bike* behaviour of cycling from public transport may be less common than cycling to ride. 

### Limitations

This research has not considered all factors that may influence cycling behaviour, such as socio-economic factors, infrastructure, time, and weather. Nearby facilities may influence behaviour, such as parks, stations and places of interest. The variables may be proxies of the actual dominant conditions, in which case my discussions may be drawing incorrect conclusions. The journeys by classic cycles on LCHS may not be the representation of the cycling behaviour in London as a whole, which does not take into consideration private cycles, e-scooters, and other bicycle hire schemes. 

Potential future research can focus on the difference in behaviour on outbound and return trips. The nature of cycle hire schemes allows one-way cycling journeys, which is not a practical option for private-owned bicycles. The assymetrical dataset indicates some traits of one-way usage, which may lead to a further understanding of cycling behaviour in cities.

## Conclusion

In this research, the correlation between elevation of individual docking stations and departure-arrival ratio was explored, suggesting uphills have negative impact on cycling behaviour. On the other hand, this was not a significant factor to the macro-scale origin-destination journey frequency.  The field of studying cycling behaviour through cycle hire data is growing rapidly [@beecham2015], and further research is expected for the better understanding of the effect of the physical environment on cycle hire flows.
