## Introduction

## Literature Review

Cycling behaviour is affected by a number of factors. @rodriguez2004 explored the impacts of the physical environment such as the topography and the existence of sidewalks and bike paths to modal choices, and have found that a positive slope (uphill) reduces the odds of walking or cycling. @gebhart2014 has explored how weather conditions affect the number of bikeshare trips in Washington DC, finding uncomfortable conditions including cold weather, precipitation, and high humidity reduces bikeshare usage.

## Research Question

Is there a correlation between the quantity or duration of cycle hire trips and the slope of the physical environment?

## Hypothesis

The trips involving uphill paths will be discouraged, thus leading to a smaller number of trips done by the cycle hire scheme. For the trips that do occur, the duration will be significantly longer compared to their downhill counterparts.

## Data

Transport for London (TfL) makes data for the Santander Cycle Hire Scheme publicly available. The location of docking stations is available from the TfL Unified API [@transportforlondon2023a], where real time availability is updated along with the name, ID, and the number of docks each station has. Usage data is shared on their website as well [@transportforlondon2023], with the ID and name for start and end stations, date and time, duration, and type of cycle (conventional or e-cycle) for every journey taken by Santander Cycles.

LIDAR Composite Digital Terrain Model (DTM) [@environmentalagency2023] with a resolution of 2 m was used for extracting the elevation of docking stations. 

LSOA boundaries and congestion charge boundaries used are from the London Datastore.
